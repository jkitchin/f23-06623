    "We can model the profit from a continously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) by computing the value produced from it and subtracting the cost of operating it. Let's assume that the value a CSTR produces is given by the conversions $X$ as $F_{A0} X M$ where $F_{A0}$ is the inlet molar flow, $X$ is the conversion in the reactor, and $M$ is the value of the products formed. The cost of operating our reactor is just proportional to the volume $V$ of the reactor: $cost = V C$ where $C$ is the cost per unit volume.\n",
